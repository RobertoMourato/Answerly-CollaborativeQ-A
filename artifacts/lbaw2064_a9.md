## 4. Input Validation

> Describe how input data was validated, and provide examples to scenarios using HTML validation and server-side validation.  


We used validators 

```php 

protected function validator(array $data)
    {
        return Validator::make($data, [
            'first_name' => 'required|string|max:100',
            'last_name' => 'required|string|max:100',
            'email' => 'required|string|email|max:200|unique:user',
            'bio' => 'required|string|max:500',
            'username' => 'required|string|max:100|unique:user',
            'password' => 'required|string|min:6|confirmed',
        ]);
    }

    protected function create(array $data)
    {
        return User::create([
            'first_name' => $data['first_name'],
            'last_name' => $data['last_name'],
            'email' => $data['email'],
            'bio' => $data['bio'],
            'username' => $data['username'],
            'password' => bcrypt($data['password']),
