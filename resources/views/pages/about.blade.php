    <article>
        <p>Within the scope of the LBAW course, we were proposed to develop a web application for collaborative Questions and Answers. For this to be a commendable product, we want to assure a great user experience where the questions are easy to find and the answers helpful to the user. We aim to have an easily navigable website. A good interface is very important and the users need to be comfortable browsing the site.</p>
        <p>Throughout life, we often find ourselves wondering about questions that surely a stranger, somewhere out there knows the answer and there is no way for him to reach out to us. With our project, we aim to tackle that by building a clean and trustworthy platform where relevant questions are asked and pertinent answers are replied.</p>
