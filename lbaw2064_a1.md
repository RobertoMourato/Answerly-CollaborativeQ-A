# A1 - Collaborative Q&A

Within the scope of the LBAW course we were proposed to develop a web application for collaborative Questions and Answers. For this to be a commendable product, we want to assure a great user experience where the questions for each category are easy to find and the answers helpful to the user.

Throughout life, we often find ourselves wondering about questions that surely a stranger, somewhere out there knows the answer and there is no way for him to reach out to you. With our project, we aim to tackle that by building a clean and trustworthy platform where relevant questions are asked and pertinent answers are replied.

We aim to have an easily navigable website. A good interface is very important and the users need to be comfortable browsing the site. There should be no need for anyone to be logged in if they are just interested in looking up existing questions and their respective answers. On the other hand, if a user&#39;s goal is to ask a question or respond to an existing one, then they will need to have a registered account. Upon registering, the user will be asked to specify some of his interestsin order to create a personalized timeline for the first times he is logged in, without any search history. _Labels_ are assigned to each question, to help filter and simplify their search. Users will be able to vote whether a question is relevant or not and also get the option to receive notifications when a question of their choosing is answered (_following_ mechanism). Furthermore, answers can be _upvoted_ or _downvoted_ with the intention of telling which ones are the most helpful. Commenting answers is also an option, aiming to provide additional information to partially correct ones. Finally, users will be able to update their profile and will have their own personal score, depending on the number of votes their questions and answers have. This will tell which accounts are trustworthy and which are not.

User groups will be the following: Administrator, Moderators, Users and Guests.
Guests will be users who do not have an account on the website or are not logged in. They will be able to see questions and answers posted by the users but won&#39;t be able to interact with them. Users will be able to post and follow questions, reply answers, comment and vote (+1/-1) on any question/answer they see fit. Moderators will be Users that have some extra privileges like, for example, delete unhelpful questions or answers, move questions to the right categories, etc. Administrators will have the same powers as Moderators but will also be able to promote Users to Moderators and demote Moderators to Users.
